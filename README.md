NumPy
=====

About This Project:
-------------------
Iâ€™m Bhavik Mungekar. I created this project to understand and practice NumPy using real-world climate data. It helped me learn how NumPy works through hands-on examples and simple analysis tasks.

What I Learned:
---------------
- Basics of NumPy and its core functions
- How to load and work with data from a CSV file
- Creating, slicing, reshaping, and manipulating arrays
- Performing statistical calculations with NumPy
- Visualizing data using matplotlib and seaborn
- Applying NumPy in basic machine learning workflows

Files Included:
---------------
- climate.txt       : Dataset with temperature, rainfall, and humidity
- day0.ipynb        : Introduction to NumPy and data loading
- day1.ipynb        : Basic analysis using NumPy
- day2.ipynb        : Array slicing, reshaping, and operations
- day3.ipynb        : Using NumPy for modeling
- day4.ipynb        : Final evaluation and insights

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for later notebooks)

How I Used It:
--------------
1. I opened each notebook one by one in Jupyter.
2. I wrote and ran code to explore NumPy step by step.
3. I used the `climate.txt` data file for real analysis.
4. I practiced changing values and trying different NumPy features.

Why I Made This:
----------------
I wanted to build a strong foundation in NumPy using real data instead of just reading theory. This project helped me build confidence and apply NumPy in useful ways.
