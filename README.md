NumPy
=====

Purpose:
--------
This project is created to help beginners understand and practice NumPy using real-world climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity). The tasks are organized across multiple Jupyter notebooks.

What You Will Learn:
--------------------
- How to use NumPy for numerical operations
- How to load and work with CSV data
- Array creation, slicing, and indexing
- Performing basic statistics and calculations with NumPy
- Simple data visualization (with matplotlib or seaborn)
- Intro to machine learning (in later notebooks)

Files:
------
- climate.txt       : Raw climate data in CSV format
- day0.ipynb        : Introduction to NumPy and loading data
- day1.ipynb        : Basic analysis using NumPy arrays
- day2.ipynb        : Practice with slicing, reshaping, and operations
- day3.ipynb        : Using NumPy for simple modeling
- day4.ipynb        : Final analysis and model evaluation

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (optional, for model building)

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open each notebook (day0 to day4) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the code and explanations step by step.
3. Try modifying the code and running your own examples.
4. Use the `climate.txt` file for hands-on NumPy practice.
